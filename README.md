# Pedestrian Simulator
This repository implements a pedestrian simulator based on the social forces implementation of [`libpedsim`](https://github.com/chgloor/pedsim). It features 

- Pedestrian spawn/goal locations encoded in `xml` format
- Static obstacles that the pedestrians react to can be configured
- Support for uncertain pedestrian dynamics (Gaussian or Mixture of Gaussian)
- Support for ROS/ROS2


> **Disclaimer:** This is an internal package used for research purposes. The implementation was not designed to share and has not been documented in detail. Please use with care.
